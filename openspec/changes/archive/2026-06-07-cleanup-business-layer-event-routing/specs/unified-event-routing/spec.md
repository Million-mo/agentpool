## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: All events flow through EventBus with stream bridge
The system SHALL publish all agent stream events and tool events to `EventBus` through the stream consumer (`_stream_events()`). `process_tool_event()` SHALL NOT publish events directly to `EventBus`. `run_ctx.event_queue` SHALL NOT be used as an event channel between tools and the stream consumer. `TurnRunner` SHALL create a per-run EventBus subscriber that feeds events back into the stream. `TurnRunner` SHALL NOT start a `_consume_event_queue` background task.

**ADDED**: Business layer code (tools, workers, delegators) SHALL NOT perform manual event routing, wrapping, or subscription. All event forwarding from business layer to frontend SHALL be handled exclusively by the protocol layer via EventBus `scope="descendants"` subscription.

#### Scenario: Tool event does not enter run_ctx.event_queue
- **WHEN** a tool emits an event via `StreamEventEmitter._emit()`
- **THEN** the event is published directly to `EventBus`
- **AND** the event is NOT put into `run_ctx.event_queue`

#### Scenario: Tool events flow through stream consumer
- **WHEN** `process_tool_event()` processes a tool event during agent execution
- **THEN** the event is returned to the caller
- **AND** the caller puts the event into the local event queue
- **AND** `_stream_events()` yields the event from the local queue
- **AND** the event is NOT published directly to `EventBus` by `process_tool_event()`

#### Scenario: No dual-consumer race
- **WHEN** a tool emits an event during an active turn
- **THEN** the event appears exactly once in the EventBus
- **AND** the event is NOT consumed by a competing `run_ctx.event_queue` reader
- **AND** the event flows through a single FIFO path: pydantic-ai → local queue → `_stream_events()` → TurnRunner → EventBus

#### Scenario: Tool events visible in stream
- **WHEN** a tool emits events during agent execution
- **THEN** the events are yielded by `agent._run_stream_once()`
- **AND** the events are visible to the stream consumer (`TurnRunner`)
- **AND** `ToolCallStartEvent` is emitted before `ToolCallCompleteEvent` for each tool call

#### Scenario: TurnRunner stream forwarding
- **WHEN** `TurnRunner` executes `_run_stream_once()` and yields events
- **THEN** each yielded event is published to `EventBus` exactly once
- **AND** no fallback consumer duplicates the event

#### Scenario: NativeAgent process_tool_event works
- **WHEN** tool events flow through the TurnRunner-managed stream
- **THEN** `NativeAgent._stream_events()` calls `process_tool_event()` on those events
- **AND** combined tool call events are correctly generated
- **AND** `process_tool_event()` does not publish directly to EventBus

#### Scenario: Duplicate event suppression
- **WHEN** the stream path produces `ToolCallStartEvent` and `ToolCallCompleteEvent` for a tool call
- **THEN** no duplicate events from `EventBusHooksAdapter` appear on the EventBus
- **AND** exactly one `ToolCallStartEvent` and one `ToolCallCompleteEvent` are delivered per tool call

#### Scenario: PartStartEvent tool call mapping
- **WHEN** pydantic-ai emits `PartStartEvent(part=BaseToolCallPart)` during agent execution
- **THEN** the system maps it to `ToolCallStartEvent` and places the mapped event into the local event queue
- **AND** the original `PartStartEvent` is also placed into the local event queue for `process_tool_event()` tracking
- **AND** `process_tool_event()` processes the original `PartStartEvent` to update `pending_tool_calls`

#### Scenario: Business layer does not manually route events
- **WHEN** a business layer tool or worker initiates a subagent run
- **THEN** the business layer SHALL NOT subscribe to EventBus directly
- **AND** the business layer SHALL NOT wrap events in `SubAgentEvent` and emit via local event system
- **AND** the business layer SHALL NOT consume events from EventBus to write to filesystem or other side channels
- **AND** all events from the subagent run SHALL reach EventBus exclusively via the agent's native stream path

#### Scenario: Protocol layer receives all subagent events
- **WHEN** a protocol handler subscribes to a session with `scope="descendants"`
- **AND** a subagent is spawned within that session
- **THEN** all events from the subagent run are received by the protocol handler
- **AND** no manual event forwarding from business layer is required

#### Scenario: ClaudeCodeAgent event flow
- **WHEN** a ClaudeCodeAgent runs through SessionPool
- **AND** a tool emits events
- **THEN** the events flow through EventBus and back into the stream
- **AND** no dual-consumer race occurs

#### Scenario: ACPAgent event flow
- **WHEN** an ACPAgent runs through SessionPool
- **AND** a tool emits events
- **THEN** the events flow through EventBus and back into the stream
- **AND** no dual-consumer race occurs

### Requirement: EventBus descendant scope routes child events to parent
Protocol handlers SHALL subscribe to `EventBus` with `scope="descendants"`. The system SHALL deliver events from child sessions to parent session subscribers automatically.

#### Scenario: ACP handler receives child events
- **WHEN** an ACP client subscribes to a parent session
- **AND** a subagent creates a child session and emits events
- **THEN** the ACP client receives the child session events

#### Scenario: OpenCode handler receives child events
- **WHEN** an OpenCode client subscribes to a parent session
- **AND** a subagent creates a child session and emits events
- **THEN** the OpenCode client receives the child session events

#### Scenario: AG-UI handler receives child events
- **WHEN** an AG-UI client subscribes to a parent session
- **AND** a subagent creates a child session and emits events
- **THEN** the AG-UI client receives the child session events
