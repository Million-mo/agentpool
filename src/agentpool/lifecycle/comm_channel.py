"""CommChannel dimension: DirectChannel and ProtocolChannel.

The CommChannel abstracts event delivery and feedback reception for the
RunLoop. It owns the Journal reference and handles event persistence
internally (append for deltas, upsert for entity-state events).

Two implementations are provided:

- **DirectChannel** — unidirectional; publishes events to an internal
  ``asyncio.Queue`` that ``RunLoop.start()`` drains via ``get_nowait()``.
  ``recv()`` always returns ``None``.

- **ProtocolChannel** — bidirectional; publishes events to the
  ``EventBus`` for protocol server consumption and maintains a feedback
  queue for steer/followup messages from ``SessionController``.
